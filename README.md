# Test Staging

I have bundled a bunch of test dependencies here for convenience.

`arcs` is a series of tiny archives to test extraction with.

Repos and where they come from:
- 'git': https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher
- 'hg': https://bitbucket.org/sjl/hg-prompt/
- 'tmux.tar.gz': https://github.com/tmux/tmux/releases/download/2.0/tmux-2.0.tar.gz
